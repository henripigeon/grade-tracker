# Academic Progress Tracker

This project is a simple web application that allows you to track your academic progress by adding courses and grades. It uses HTML and CSS for structure and styling, and JavaScript with localStorage to handle the interactive functionality.

## Files

- **index.html**: The main HTML file that structures the website.
- **styles.css**: Contains the CSS styling for the website, including responsive design rules.
- **script.js**: Handles user interactions, such as adding, editing, and deleting progress entries, and stores data in localStorage.

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
2. Use the form in the **Add New Progress** section to add a course and its grade.
3. The progress list will update automatically.
4. Edit or delete existing entries as needed.

## Future Improvements

- Integrate Firebase for real-time database functionality.
- Enhance the UI with more advanced styling or animations.
- Add user authentication and personalized progress tracking.

Enjoy tracking your academic progress!
